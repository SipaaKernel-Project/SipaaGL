# SipaaGL
SipaaGL is a graphics library with many features (and many bugs)!

## Current features
* VBE Canvas with alpha support
* VBE Console (maybe the original developer got the idea from SipaaKernel?)
* Colors (with a custom color class)
* TTF, BitFont & PSF fonts rendering
* TGA, PNG & BMP images rendering
* Rounded corners (aliased)

## What's to be implemented / fixed?
* Blur effects
* Fix linear gradients
